  <p>A game I'm sure you've heard of that is a lot more fun than it sounds is one where you go to Wikipedia and get from one Wikipedia page to the other only by clicking links on the page.<br>Here are a few examples you can use to challenge yourself.</p>
  <ol id="game">
    <li>We'll start easy: try going from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper">this page (paper)</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest">this page (forest)</a>.
    <section class="listdiv">
      <input type="checkbox" class="showans">Show Answer
      <p class="ans">All you have to do for this is click on wood, then trees, and then there is a forest section in the tree page. This obviously isn't the only solution, just the one I found.</p>
    </section></li>
    <li>Now let's do a couple harder examples to help you get the hang of things. First: go from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design">web design page</a> to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermostat">thermostat page</a>. (Using ctrl + f or cmd + f is allowed.)
    <section class="listdiv">
      <input type="checkbox" class="showans">Show Answer
      <p class="ans">Web Design -> User interface design -> Home appliances -> Air conditioning -> HVAC -> Thermostat</p>
    </section></li>
    <li>Second: go from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkness">darkness page</a> to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress">United States Congress page</a>.
    <section class="listdiv">
      <input type="checkbox" class="showans">Show Answer
      <p class="ans">Darkness -> Old english -> English language -> American english -> United States -> Congress</p>
    </section></li>
    <li>Lets do a more specific destination. Try going from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress">United States Congress page</a> where we ended off last time to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_State_University">Kansas State University</a>. This one is can be hard because Kansas State University is such a specific page, but it's pretty straightforward as long as you look a little harder.
    <section class="listdiv">
      <input type="checkbox" class="showans">Show Answer
      <p class="ans">United States Congress -> State -> Kansas -> Kansas State University</p>
    </section></li>
    <li>Next is the final challenge, this will test your skills in not only relating 2 things, but also your ability to quickly learn and adapt as you will be dropped in a page of a different language (changing the language is cheating). Try going from the <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%8C%B6">茶 (Word for tea in both Chinese and Japanese)</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper">paper page</a> were we started all this. If you need a hint: you most likly will have no clue what you are looking at, try to find things that you recognize like english words or dates or times. Your main priority should be getting to an english page which is possible. Remeber highlighting over somthing will give you a preview of the page. And in the bottom left you can see were a link will send you. From there you shouldn't struggle.
    <section class="listdiv">
      <input type="checkbox" class="showans">Show Answer
      <p class="ans">茶 -> 2019年 -> Unix Time -> Google Chrome -> 英語版 (I saw this linked to the english page of chromebook) -> tablet -> digital pen -> handwriting -> writing -> inscribed -> paper</p>
